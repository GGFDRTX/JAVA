My Java Learning Journey 🌟  

Hi there! 👋  

Welcome to my Java learning repository. I'm just starting out with Java, and this is where I’ll be sharing my progress, experiments, and small projects as I dive into the world of programming with Java.

 📂 What's Inside?  

Right now, it’s just the beginning, so you’ll find:  
- Basic Java Programs:
  - Simple programs to understand the syntax and basics of Java.  
  - Examples include basic input/output, variables, and conditional statements.  

- Small Practice Files: 
  - A few hands-on exercises as I practice loops, arrays, and basic functions.

 🌟 Why This Repo?  

This repository is my personal space to track my learning progress and share what I’ve been working on. Even though it’s a small start, I’m excited to keep adding more as I learn about Java’s powerful features like object-oriented programming, data structures, and more.

 ✨ What’s Next?  

Here’s what I plan to add soon:  
- More practice with loops and arrays.  
- Dive into object-oriented programming (OOP).  
- Start exploring real-world problem-solving with Java.
